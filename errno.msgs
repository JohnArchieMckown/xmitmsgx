* These messages were initially gathered from C headers on Linux,
* which in turn includes C headers from GLIBC and other packages.
* Additional messages gathered from C headers included with CYGWIN.
*
* The next line sets the token introducer.
& 3
* Also indicates default number of digits, which we ignore.

* We don't implement format numbers or line numbers but leave
* those in this file for compatibility with the CMS impmenentation.
