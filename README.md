# xmitmsg (http://travis-ci.org/glv/smithereen)

xmitmsg is a library and function for presenting enumerated messages.
It follows the rationale and source format of IBM VM/CMS 'XMITMSG'
except that the message repository does not have to be pre-processed.

## Rationale

Application messages in context can be referenced by number.
The text of the message can be made available in any local language.
Tokens, for lack of a better term, can be inserted into the message 
with correct placement.
